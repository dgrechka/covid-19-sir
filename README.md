## App to explore the COVID-19 predictions worldwide

The app provides a way to explore COVID-19 epidemic dynamics prediction using [SIR model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model). I made these predictions a a part of [Kaggle COVID19 Global Forecasting Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-3).

The app with recent predictions is deployed [here](https://grechka.family/dmitry/blog/explore-covid-19-predictions/).
